## Key Insights

### Signal Strength & Execution
- **EXECUTE on |impact| > 50 with confidence 1.0**: Highest priority signals
- **Trade on |impact| ≥ 40 with confidence 1.0**: Still strong signals worth executing
- **ARBITRAGE situations are golden**: KXFEDMENTION-26JAN with YES sum = 1813c makes NO positions mathematically profitable
- **Signal reinforcement is powerful**: When signals support existing positions, add size confidently
- **SIGNAL REVERSALS ARE CRITICAL**: When signals flip direction, act immediately
- **PERSISTENT SIGNALS = ADD SIZE**: When strong signals continue across cycles, increase position size
- **SIGNAL SATURATION POINT**: When all strong signals are maximized, hold positions and monitor
- **EXCEPTIONAL VALUE OPPORTUNITIES**: 100:1 risk/reward with high-confidence signals deserve maximum size

### Market Patterns
1. **Fed Mention Markets**: Strong negative sentiment about political mentions translates to NO positions
2. **OUT Markets**: Negative sentiment inverts to positive impact (scandal → more likely OUT)
3. **Low-priced YES opportunities**: Khamenei OUT at 2-3c with +40 signal is excellent risk/reward

### Latest Status (2026-01-28 07:53) - FULL OPTIMIZATION ACHIEVED
- **All strong signals maximized**: No new |impact| > 40 signals appearing
- **ARBITRAGE maintained**: YES sum = 1813c in Fed mention event
- **Position status**: 6/43 markets in Fed mention event, 100 contracts in Khamenei
- **Signal persistence**: Same high-confidence signals continuing across multiple cycles
- **Value maximization**: Added maximum size to exceptional Khamenei opportunity

### Key Positions Performance
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-PRES**: 160 NO contracts (-75 impact signals)
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-TRUM**: 120 NO contracts (-75/-40 impact signals)
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-SHUT**: 45 NO contracts (-40 impact signals)
