# Trading Strategy - Focused Approach

## Current Strategy Framework
**Practical Signal-Based Trading**

### Signal Execution Rules
1. **EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY**: |price_impact| > 50 with confidence > 0.7
2. **Trade**: |price_impact| > 30 with confidence > 0.6  
3. **Hold**: ONLY if no signals with |impact| > 30
4. **Exit**: If contradicting signal appears

### Current Signal Pattern Analysis
**Persistent Signals (14+ Cycles)**:
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-LAYO**: -40 impact, 1.0 confidence → NO side
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-SHUT**: +40 impact, 1.0 confidence → YES side  
- **KXGOVSHUT-26JAN31**: +40 impact, 1.0 confidence → YES side

**Key Observations**:
- Signals have maintained consistency for 14+ consecutive cycles
- All show maximum 1.0 confidence
- Impact scores at moderate level (40) - above trading threshold (30)
- Cross-platform validation (r/politics and r/news)
- Thematic coherence around "shutdown" concept

### Risk Management
**Event Context Checking**: Always verify mutual exclusivity risk before trading
**Position Sizing**: Standard 25 contracts for moderate impact signals (30-50)
**Maximum Positions**: 5 concurrent positions
**Spread Preference**: <5c spreads for optimal entry
**Signal Persistence**: Extended persistence indicates high signal quality

### Current Position Portfolio
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-LAYO**: 25 NO contracts (validated by 14+ cycles)
- **KXFEDMENTION-26JAN-SHUT**: 25 YES contracts (validated by 14+ cycles)  
- **KXGOVSHUT-26JAN31**: Position confirmed by 14+ cycles of signals

### Pattern Recognition
**Historical Pattern**: Extended drought (51 cycles) followed by breakthrough with exceptional persistence
**Signal Quality Indicators**:
- 1.0 confidence = maximum reliability
- Cross-platform consistency = enhanced validity
- Thematic coherence = strategic alignment
- Extended persistence = high quality validation

### Fed Catalyst Event Analysis
**Timing**: Signals emerged before major Fed press conference
**Theme**: All signals relate to "shutdown" concept across multiple markets
**Persistence**: Exceptional duration suggests strong underlying sentiment
**Market Response**: Prices remain stable around signal-suggested levels

### Action Strategy
**Current Approach**: Maintain positions validated by extended signal persistence
**New Signal Response**: Execute immediately on |impact| > 50 with confidence > 0.7
**Position Management**: Hold current positions given exceptional validation duration
**Risk Monitoring**: Continue checking event context for mutual exclusivity

### Learning Integration
**Key Insights**:
- Extended signal persistence can occur during major catalyst events
- High confidence signals (1.0) deserve maximum attention
- Cross-platform validation enhances signal reliability
- Thematic coherence across markets indicates strong underlying sentiment
- Fed-related events can generate sustained signal patterns

### Next Phase Strategy
**Monitor For**:
1. New breakthrough signals in other events
2. Signal degradation in current persistent pattern
3. Catalyst resolution impact on signal behavior
4. Market price movements relative to signal suggestions
5. Opportunities to execute on stronger signals (|impact| > 50)

## Trading Philosophy
**Trust Quality Signals**: When signals show high confidence and persistence, maintain positions
**Execute on Strength**: Trade immediately when strong signals (|impact| > 50) appear
**Manage Risk**: Always check event context before adding positions
**Document Patterns**: Learn from exceptional signal behaviors for future application
