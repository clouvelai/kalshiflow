# Kalshi Market Knowledge (Empirical)

## Microstructure (Becker 2025, 72.1M trades)
- Makers +1.12% excess return, takers -1.12%
- NO outperforms YES at 69/99 price levels
- Fee: 0.07 x C x P x (1-P), peaks at 50c (~1.75c/contract)
- Category efficiency: Finance (0.17pp) > Sports (2.23pp) > Entertainment (4.79pp) > World Events (7.32pp)

## Behavioral Biases
- Longshot bias: extreme YES prices (<15c) systematically overpriced
- YES-side bias: bettors prefer buying YES (creates structural NO value)
- Recency bias: markets overreact to recent events, then revert

## Fee by Price Point
- 10c/90c: ~0.63c | 25c/75c: ~1.31c | 50c: ~1.75c (max)

## What Works
- Statistical models on modelable variables
- Information speed (react to news before market absorbs)
- Longshot bias exploitation (systematic NO at extreme YES)
- What does NOT work: pure forecasting, gut feel, high-volume low-conviction

## Microstructure Interpretation (Hypotheses — Validate via Experience)
- YES ratio > 70% + price rising = bullish momentum (HYPOTHESIS: validate)
- YES ratio > 70% + price flat = informed selling into retail flow (HYPOTHESIS: validate)
- Large orders on one side = whale conviction signal
- Volume imbalance > +0.3 = strong buy pressure
- Spread widening + depth falling = liquidity withdrawal (sharp move incoming)
- Wide spread at entry (>6c) erases edge even on correct direction (HYPOTHESIS: validate)
- Whale orders contradicting extraction signal = strong countervailing signal (HYPOTHESIS: validate)
