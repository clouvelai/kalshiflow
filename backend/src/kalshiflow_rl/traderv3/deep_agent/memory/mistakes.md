## Pre-seeded Anti-Patterns (from research)

### M-1: Trading Stale Signals [pre-seeded]
Signals >2h old with high engagement from the start are likely priced in. Check price movement first.

### M-2: Overtrading on Low Conviction [pre-seeded]
1 Reddit post at 50 upvotes is noise, not evidence. Most extraction signals should be PASS.

### M-3: Ignoring Spread Cost [pre-seeded]
Wide spreads (>6c) erase small edges. Calculate: expected move > spread/2?

### M-4: Confirmation Bias in Reasoning [pre-seeded]
LLMs confirm initial leanings through reasoning chains. When building a case FOR a trade, explicitly build the case AGAINST before deciding.
