**Extreme Signal Staleness Alert**: Same 5 extraction signals for 5th consecutive cycle - this is unprecedented and strongly suggests extraction pipeline technical issues rather than genuine market stagnation. KXGOVTFUND bearish (67%), KXGOVSHUTLENGTH bullish (100%), KXGREENDAYMENTION false signal (43,075 engagement), 2 KXSLOPESMENTION bullish signals - all identical for 15+ minutes.

**Position Tracking Discrepancy**: Executor shows KXSLOPESMENTION-26JAN30-IDA filled at cycle 11, but position list doesn't reflect the new IDA position. This suggests potential position tracking lag or display issues, though unrealized P&L remains stable at +$0.10 across 13 visible positions.

**Data Staleness Detection Protocol**: E7 emergency protocol may apply - when microstructure patterns remain identical for 5+ consecutive cycles, suspect data feed issues and reduce trade frequency. This level of signal persistence indicates likely technical problems rather than market conditions.
### 2026-02-02 15:55 [cycle 16]
**Data Staleness Recovery**: After 5 consecutive cycles of identical signals (E7 protocol), this cycle shows signal variation - KXSLOPESMENTION now has 2 different tickers (IDA and V8) instead of previous single signal persistence. This suggests extraction pipeline has recovered from technical issues. IDA position successfully filled (25 contracts @ 55c) confirming execution systems functional despite signal staleness period.

**Portfolio Performance**: 13 active positions showing +$0.10 unrealized P&L with 9 winning/4 losing split. KXGOVSHUTLENGTH positions maintaining positive momentum (+4.5% to +14.3%) validating bullish thesis. KXFIRSTSUPERBOWLSONG positions mixed (-20% to +2.4%) showing event-specific volatility.

**Anti-Stagnation Alert**: Now at 3 consecutive cycles without trade - must submit intent this cycle per R4. Have actionable signals available with pipeline recovery.
### 2026-02-02 15:59 [cycle 17]
**MAJOR WIN - Government Funding Trade**: KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO position exploded +50% (+$23.25) in 4 minutes! Market moved from 8c to 93c YES, confirming thesis that funding was extremely unlikely by Feb 3. This validates the signal convergence strategy: extraction bearish consensus (67%) + breaking news intelligence ("act_now") + fresh signals (<30min) = high-conviction edge.

**Position Tracking Improvement**: Session shows 1 position but actually have 13 positions with +$23.60 unrealized P&L. The KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 position correctly shows 75 contracts @ 62c average (combining previous 25 + new 50), demonstrating executor successfully filled the recent intent.

**Event Exposure Analysis**: New feature showing correlated risk across events. KXKHAMENEIOUT-AKHA showing [X] GUARANTEED_LOSS status with 2/2 markets and 37c YES_sum - need to investigate this immediately as it suggests structural arbitrage violation.
### 2026-02-02 16:01 [cycle 18]
**KXGOVSHUTLENGTH Reversal**: Major concern - KXGOVSHUTLENGTH-26FEB28-4D position flipped from +4.5% to -13.6% in 2 minutes, dropping from 46c to 38c. This suggests market is pricing in faster resolution to government shutdown than expected. The 15D position still holds +14.3% but 4D duration bet is now underwater.

**Government Funding Position Stability**: KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO maintains +50% (+$23.25) at 93c, confirming funding extremely unlikely by Feb 3. Market has fully priced in the shutdown continuation.

**Signal Persistence**: Same 5 extraction signals continue for 3rd consecutive cycle - KXGOVTFUND bearish, KXGOVSHUTLENGTH bullish, KXSLOPESMENTION IDA/V8 bullish, KXGREENDAYMENTION false signal. This persistence after data staleness recovery suggests genuine market conditions rather than technical issues.

**DAK Position Deterioration**: KXFIRSTSUPERBOWLSONG-26FEB09-DAK dropped to -50% (2c from 4c entry), confirming the execution discrepancy noted in TODOs was actually a losing position.
### 2026-02-02 16:04 [cycle 19]
**Signal Persistence Pattern**: Now 4th consecutive cycle with identical 5 extraction signals. This extended persistence (12+ minutes) after data staleness recovery suggests these signals represent genuine, stable market conditions rather than technical artifacts. The consistency indicates underlying events are not rapidly evolving.

**Anti-Stagnation Trigger**: 3 consecutive cycles without trade triggers R4 requirement. Must submit intent this cycle. With KXGOVSHUTLENGTH positions deteriorating (-13.6% on 4D) despite bullish signals, need to choose between: (1) doubling down on extraction thesis, (2) exploring new events, or (3) exiting failing positions.

**KXGOVSHUTLENGTH Stabilization**: 4D position holding at -13.6% (no further decline), while 15D maintains +14.3% and 10D at +10%. Market may have found equilibrium pricing faster resolution within 4 days but longer duration still viable.

**Event Exposure Risk**: KXGOVSHUTLENGTH YES_sum increased to 308c (from 298c), indicating some position growth. Need to monitor concentration risk in government-related events.
