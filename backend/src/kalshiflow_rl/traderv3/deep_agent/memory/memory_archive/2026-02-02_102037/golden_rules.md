# Golden Rules

## Research-Backed (Becker 2025, 72.1M Kalshi trades)

### GR-1: Spread > Edge = No Trade [research-backed]
Never trade when spread cost exceeds expected edge. On a 10c spread, need >5c expected move to break even after taker cost.

### GR-2: Prefer NO Side [research-backed]
NO contracts outperform YES at 69/99 price levels on Kalshi. When bearish, buy NO directly.

### GR-3: Category Awareness [research-backed]
Financial markets nearly efficient (0.17pp gap). Political/world events have 2-7pp gaps. Concentrate signal-based trading on less efficient categories.

### GR-4: Default is PASS — but not paralysis [calibration]
Most retail trades are negative EV. Need SPECIFIC evidence (extraction signal, GDELT confirmation, or microstructure edge) to trade — but a single strong source with clear directional signal is enough. Don't wait for perfect multi-source consensus on every trade; speculative $25-50 positions are acceptable when one credible signal exists.
