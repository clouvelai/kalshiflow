# Learnings


## Session End-of-Session Summary

**Session Duration**: 0 minutes (1 cycle)
**Performance**: No trades executed - session ended before market evaluation

### Key Session Insights:

1. **Strategy Foundation**: Reviewed current strategy.md - it's a solid framework but needs development through actual trading experience. The core risk management ($100 per event) and signal evaluation approach are sound.

2. **Session Too Brief**: This session ended before I could evaluate extraction signals or execute any trades. In future sessions, I need to prioritize getting to signal evaluation quickly to maximize learning opportunities.

3. **Portfolio State**: Starting with $2,386,436 balance, 500 historical trades with 0% win rate suggests this is a fresh start or reset. Need to focus on building positive edge through systematic signal evaluation.

4. **Next Session Priority**: Immediately call get_extraction_signals() to identify active market opportunities and begin the observe-analyze-trade-reflect cycle.

5. **Strategy Development Need**: The current strategy.md has good risk management but lacks specific entry criteria. Need to develop these through actual trading experience - what source counts, engagement levels, and consensus thresholds lead to profitable trades.

**Action for Next Session**: Start with get_extraction_signals() immediately, then focus on executing at least 1-2 trades to begin building the experience base needed to refine strategy.md with specific, data-driven entry rules.
