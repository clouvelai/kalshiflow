## Cycle 20 - 2026-02-02 16:18
- **Signals**: 6 extraction signals analyzed across 4 events: KXGOVERNORMENTION-26FEB03-TRIB emerged as new strong signal (magnitude 70, engagement 28,068), KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA maintained 2-cycle persistence (magnitude 55, engagement 43,250), government signals (KXGOVTFUND bearish 67%, KXGOVSHUTLENGTH bullish 100%) continued with slight degradation, KXSLOPESMENTION institutional pattern persisted (IDA magnitude 100, V8 magnitude 50).
- **Decisions**: TRADE - Submitted intent for KXGREENDAYMENTION-26FEB08-MAGA YES x25 @ max 52c based on persistent strong extraction signal with 2-cycle momentum. PASS - Rejected KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB despite strong signal due to prohibitive 19c spread violating GR-1 (spread > edge rule). No action on government positions (already held per R2) or KXSLOPESMENTION (no fresh catalyst).
- **Reasoning**: Key insight: Signal persistence (KXGREENDAYMENTION 2-cycle maintenance) more valuable than single-cycle strength for conviction building. Spread analysis crucial - KXGOVERNORMENTION strong signal (magnitude 70) rejected due to 19c spread vs KXGREENDAYMENTION weaker signal (magnitude 55) accepted due to 2c spread. News intelligence confirmed government funding crisis with "act_now" recommendation, validating existing positions. Grammy event timing creates natural exit catalyst for MAGA mention trade.
- **Watching**: Continue monitoring KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA position through Grammy Awards (Feb 8). Watch for KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB spread tightening - strong extraction signal may become tradeable if spread narrows. Government funding resolution timeline critical for KXGOVTFUND/KXGOVSHUTLENGTH positions - Tuesday House vote could trigger exits. KXSLOPESMENTION institutional pattern remains intriguing but needs fresh development beyond whale activity.


## Cycle 21 - 2026-02-02 16:22
- **Signals**: 6 extraction signals analyzed: KXSLOPESMENTION-IDA (magnitude 100, engagement 14,730) and V8 (magnitude 50) maintaining whale institutional pattern. KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA persisting 3rd cycle (magnitude 55, engagement 43,250). KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB strong single signal (magnitude 70, engagement 28,068). Government signals mixed - KXGOVTFUND bearish consensus weakened to 67% from 100%, KXGOVSHUTLENGTH-4D maintains 100% bullish consensus.
- **Decisions**: WAIT - No new trade intents submitted. Existing positions maintained across 6 events (13 total positions). KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA position from cycle 20 performing well (filled at 51c, market 49-51c). KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB rejected due to prohibitive 19c spread despite strong extraction signal.
- **Reasoning**: Key pattern emerging: Signal persistence over multiple cycles (KXGREENDAYMENTION 3-cycle run) appears more predictive than single-cycle magnitude spikes. Government funding dynamics shifting - KXGOVTFUND bearish consensus weakening suggests market beginning to price in resolution possibilities while KXGOVSHUTLENGTH maintains shutdown duration expectations. News intelligence confirms ongoing negotiations with House vote Tuesday, supporting current position thesis. KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern continues but no fresh catalyst to warrant position size increase.
- **Watching**: Continue monitoring KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA through Grammy Awards Feb 8 (natural exit catalyst). Watch KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB for spread tightening - strong extraction signal may become tradeable if spread narrows from 19c. Government funding resolution timeline critical - Tuesday House vote could trigger position adjustments. KXSLOPESMENTION institutional pattern remains intriguing but needs fresh development beyond persistent whale activity.


## Cycle 22 - 2026-02-02 16:25
- **Signals**: CRITICAL: Data staleness detected in pre-loaded signals (identical to cycle 21), but fresh 1-hour extraction shows major changes. KXGOVTFUND consensus FLIPPED from bearish 67% to bullish 100% (magnitude 75). KXGREENDAYMENTION engagement doubled to 86,325. KXGOVERNORMENTION maintains strong signal (magnitude 70, engagement 28,068) but 19c spread prohibitive. KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern continues.
- **Decisions**: TRADE - Submitted exit intent for KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO x75 due to signal reversal. Extraction consensus flipped from bearish to bullish, indicating thesis invalidation. Position already declining (-$0.75) as market prices in higher funding probability.
- **Reasoning**: KEY INSIGHT: Pre-loaded signals showed data staleness (identical to cycle 21) but fresh extraction pipeline revealed critical changes. Signal reversal (bearish→bullish) more important than news intelligence "monitor" recommendation - extraction signals often lead mainstream news. Position tracking inconsistency noted (executor shows cycle 11 vs memory cycle 20 for KXGREENDAYMENTION). Portfolio performance declined -$0.85 primarily from government positions.
- **Watching**: Monitor KXGOVTFUND-26FEB04 NO position for similar exit if signals continue bullish. Watch KXGREENDAYMENTION fresh momentum (engagement doubled). KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB strong signal awaiting spread tightening. Continue KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern monitoring. Track government funding developments through Tuesday House vote.


## Cycle 23 - 2026-02-02 16:28
- **Signals**: Fresh 1-hour signals show KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 maintains bullish consensus (magnitude 60) but with lower engagement (14 vs previous 68-75). KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA persists with strong engagement (86,325). KXGOVERNORMENTION-TRIB unchanged (magnitude 70, engagement 28,068). KXGOVSHUTLENGTH-4D continues bullish (magnitude 60). KXSLOPESMENTION absent from fresh signals.
