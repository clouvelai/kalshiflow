Government funding news intelligence confirms deadline pressure.
- **Decisions**: TRADE - KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA YES x25 contracts. Exceptional extraction signal persistence (43,250 engagement, 100% bullish consensus) with minimal 1c spread at 40c. Market appears to undervalue probability given sustained social media momentum.

- **Decisions**: WAIT - No new trade intents. Position tracking discrepancies observed: KXGREENDAYMENTION-MAGA shows ACTIVE in executor but missing from open positions. Multiple positions marked "expired" in executor.
- **Reasoning**: Position tracking reliability concerns per E4 protocol. Several positions (KXSLOPESMENTION-IDA, KXGOVSHUTLENGTH-4D, KXSLOPESMENTION-WSHM) show "expired" status in executor, suggesting rapid event resolutions or system issues. Portfolio shows 15 positions vs expected 16.
