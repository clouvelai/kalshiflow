- **Decisions**: TRADE: Submitted KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO x50 at max 94c based on bearish extraction signals + news intelligence confirmation of political tensions and deadline pressure. PASS on other signals due to inactive markets.
- **Reasoning**: Position tracking system now stable with clean data. KXGOVTFUND represents good diversification opportunity with 2c spread and tomorrow resolution providing quick feedback. News intelligence confirmed extraction signal thesis about funding difficulties. Other strong signals (GREENDAYMENTION, GOVERNORMENTION, SLOPESMENTION) lack active markets for new entries.
- **Watching**: Monitor KXGOVTFUND position fill and price movement toward Feb 3 resolution. Watch for KXGREENDAYMENTION market reactivation closer to Feb 8 event. Continue tracking KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern persistence - 15+ cycle duration suggests major development approaching. Monitor existing positions across multiple events for exit opportunities.


## Cycle 32 - 2026-02-02 16:56
- **Signals**: Same signals as previous cycle: KXGOVTFUND bearish (67% consensus), KXGREENDAYMENTION bullish (43,250 engagement), KXGOVERNORMENTION fresh signal (magnitude 70), KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern continues.
- **Decisions**: EMERGENCY TRADING HALT - PASS on all trades due to critical system corruption detected in execution pricing per E9 protocol.
- **Reasoning**: CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO position shows impossible entry price of 232c (NO contracts cannot trade above 100c). This represents system corruption in execution pricing that could cause unlimited losses. E9 emergency protocol requires immediate trading halt until execution pricing verified reliable. Cannot make trading decisions with corrupted position data.
- **Watching**: NONE - Trading halted due to system corruption. Must resolve execution pricing reliability before resuming any trading activity.


## Cycle 33 - 2026-02-02 16:58
- **Signals**: Same signals continue: KXGOVTFUND bearish (67% consensus), KXGREENDAYMENTION bullish (43,250 engagement), KXGOVERNORMENTION fresh signal (magnitude 70), KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern persists.
- **Decisions**: CONTINUED EMERGENCY TRADING HALT - PASS on all trades due to persistent system corruption in execution pricing per E9 protocol.
- **Reasoning**: EXECUTION PRICING FAILURE PERSISTS: KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO position continues showing impossible 232c entry price across multiple cycles. This confirms systematic corruption in execution pricing system rather than transient display error. E9 emergency protocol mandates continued trading halt until system reliability verified. Cannot assess risk or make trading decisions with corrupted position data.
- **Watching**: NONE - Trading remains halted due to ongoing system corruption. Execution pricing reliability must be restored before any trading activity can resume.


## Cycle 34 - 2026-02-02 17:01
- **Signals**: Same signals persist: KXGOVTFUND bearish (67% consensus), KXGREENDAYMENTION bullish (43,250 engagement), KXGOVERNORMENTION fresh signal (magnitude 70), KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern continues.
- **Decisions**: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS OVERRIDE ANTI-STAGNATION - PASS on all trades. E8 System Failure Override explicitly states emergency protocols take precedence over activity quotas when system integrity compromised.
- **Reasoning**: EXECUTION PRICING CORRUPTION PERSISTS: KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO @ 232c impossible pricing continues for 3+ cycles. Anti-stagnation alert triggered but E8 protocol overrides: "System integrity > activity quotas." Cannot trade with corrupted execution pricing - risk of unlimited losses. Emergency protocols designed for exactly this scenario.
- **Watching**: NONE - Emergency trading halt continues. System integrity must be restored before any trading activity can resume, regardless of anti-stagnation requirements.


## Cycle 35 - 2026-02-02 17:04
- **Signals**: Same signals continue: KXGOVTFUND bearish (67% consensus), KXGREENDAYMENTION bullish (43,250 engagement), KXGOVERNORMENTION fresh signal (magnitude 70), KXSLOPESMENTION whale pattern persists.
- **Decisions**: WAIT - Reassessing system status. KXGOVTFUND position corruption persists (232c impossible pricing) but other 13 positions show normal price updates, suggesting isolated rather than systematic corruption.
- **Reasoning**: MIXED SYSTEM STATUS: KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 NO @ 232c impossible pricing continues (4th cycle) but other positions updating normally (e.g., KXGOVSHUTLENGTH-10D: 8c→14c, +40%). Market data shows KXGOVTFUND-26FEB03 trading 6-8c YES (92-94c NO), confirming 232c is impossible. This suggests isolated position corruption rather than systematic execution pricing failure. Need to reassess whether complete trading halt still warranted under E9 vs allowing new trades while monitoring.
- **Watching**: Monitoring system status for potential resumption of trading. If corruption truly isolated to one legacy position, may consider resuming trading with enhanced monitoring of execution pricing on fresh orders.


## Cycle 36 - 2026-02-02 17:07
- **Signals**: KXGOVERNORMENTION-26FEB03-TRIB (fresh signal, magnitude 70, 28K engagement), KXGOVSHUTLENGTH-26FEB28-4D (2 sources, 100% bullish consensus, 23K engagement), KXGREENDAYMENTION-26FEB08-MAGA (sustained 86K engagement), KXSLOPESMENTION whale patterns continuing
