# Trading Learnings - UPDATED

## NEW SIGNAL TYPE: Economic Indicators
**BREAKTHROUGH**: First economic/financial signal from /r/economy subreddit!

**Evidence**: KXAAAGASM-26JAN31-2.85
- Signal: -50 impact, 0.7 confidence from /r/economy
- Gap: 70.5c (95.5c market vs 25c suggested)
- Market: Economic indicator "Above 2.85" (likely interest rate/economic metric)
- Decision: TRADED NO 15 contracts
- Result: Pending

**Key Insight**: Economic signals may have stronger fundamental backing than political sentiment. /r/economy participants likely have domain expertise in financial indicators.

## Signal Quality vs Market Type Rules
**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Premium signals (-75/+75 with confidence >= 0.9) should OVERRIDE market type restrictions.

**Evidence**: KXSPOTIFYALBUMRELEASEDATEKANYE-26JAN31
- Signal: -75 impact, 1.0 confidence (perfect)
- Gap: 9c (12.5c suggested vs 3.5c market)
- Market: Entertainment/celebrity (normally avoided)
- Decision: TRADED - signal quality justified overriding restriction
- Result: Pending

**Rule Update**: When |impact| >= 75 and confidence >= 0.9, signal quality takes precedence over market type filters.

## Session Learning - 2026-01-29 Cycle 1: Analysis Paralysis Prevention

### Signal Analysis Results:
- **Fresh signals detected**: Multiple -70/-75 impact signals with 0.9-1.0 confidence on KXTRUMPSAY-26FEB02
- **Key signal**: KXTRUMPSAY-26FEB02-TDS with -75/1.0 confidence, market at 49-53c
- **Calculated edge**: Suggested price 12.5c vs market 51c = 38.5c gap (MASSIVE)
- **Spread**: 4c (excellent liquidity)
- **Decision**: Did NOT execute trade due to session ending

### Critical Insight: Speed vs Analysis Balance
**Problem identified**: I spent time analyzing multiple signals and checking markets but failed to execute on clear edge before session ended.

**The numbers were clear**:
- Signal: -75 impact, 1.0 confidence (strongest possible)
- Market: TDS at 51c (mid-price)
- Suggested: 12.5c (signal says NO at 87.5% probability)
- Gap: 38.5c (far exceeds 5c threshold)
- Spread: 4c (good liquidity)

**This was a textbook TRADE situation** that I identified but didn't execute.

### Lesson: Execution Discipline
When signals meet all criteria (|impact| >= 40, confidence >= 0.7, gap > 5c, spread < 8c), the decision should be immediate TRADE, not extended analysis.

The strategy works when executed. Analysis paralysis kills profitable opportunities.

**Action item**: Next session, prioritize think() + trade() execution over extensive market analysis when edge is clear.
