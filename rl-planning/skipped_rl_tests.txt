# Skipped RL Tests for Orderbook Collection Milestone
# Date: 2024-12-09
# Updated: 2024-12-09 - All tests fixed!

## Previously Skipped Tests - NOW FIXED
1. TestCompleteDataPipeline::test_end_to_end_message_flow
   - Fixed: Sequence numbers are in outer message for both snapshots and deltas
   
2. TestCompleteDataPipeline::test_multi_market_isolation  
   - Fixed: Sequence numbers are in outer message for both snapshots and deltas

## Resolution
- Confirmed from Kalshi docs that sequence numbers are in the outer message object
- Fixed orderbook_client.py to extract seq from message.get("seq") for deltas
- All tests now passing with proper sequence number handling
