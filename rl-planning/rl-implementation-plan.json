    "Non-blocking database writes - all hot paths use async queues",

    "Environment database isolation - training env preloads all data, no DB queries during step()/reset()",
    "Pipeline isolation - training and inference never interact directly",
    "Single orderbook state - one SharedOrderbookState per market",
    "Historical data format consistency - same structure for training and live data",
    "Multi-market support - single WebSocket connection handles multiple markets with per-market state isolation",
