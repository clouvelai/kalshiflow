CLAUDE PROGRESS LOG
===================

## Milestone 1: Project Initialization
**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Time Taken:** ~30 minutes
**Status:** COMPLETED

### What Was Accomplished:

1. **Project Structure Created:**
   - Set up root directory with backend/ and frontend/ folders
   - Created .gitignore with comprehensive Python/Node/IDE exclusions
   - Created .env.example with all required Kalshi configuration variables

2. **Backend Setup (Python with uv):**
   - Initialized Python project using `uv init` with src/kalshiflow package structure
   - Added all required dependencies via uv:
     - Starlette (ASGI framework)
     - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
     - WebSockets (for real-time connections)
     - Cryptography (for RSA signature authentication)
     - Pydantic (for data models)
     - Python-dotenv (for environment variables)
     - Development tools: pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx
   - Created basic Starlette app with:
     - Health check endpoint at GET /health
     - CORS middleware configured
     - Configuration endpoint at GET /api/config

3. **Frontend Setup (React with Vite):**
   - Initialized React project using Vite
   - Configured Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
   - Set up base styling with Tailwind directives

4. **Development Workflow:**
   - Created init.sh script that:
     - Checks for required tools (uv, npm)
     - Installs all backend and frontend dependencies
     - Starts both servers with proper process management
     - Provides clean shutdown on Ctrl+C

### How It Was Validated:

1. **Backend Validation:**
   - Started server with `uv run uvicorn kalshiflow.app:app --reload`
   - Confirmed health check endpoint returns 200 with JSON response
   - Verified all dependencies installed correctly via uv

2. **Frontend Validation:**
   - Confirmed npm packages installed successfully
   - Verified Tailwind CSS configuration in place

3. **Init Script Validation:**
   - Made script executable with chmod +x
   - Verified script checks for required tools
   - Confirmed script creates .env from .env.example if missing

### Key Files Created:

**Backend:**
- `/backend/pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration with dependencies
- `/backend/src/kalshiflow/__init__.py` - Package initialization with main entry point
- `/backend/src/kalshiflow/app.py` - Starlette application with health check
- `/backend/src/kalshiflow/main.py` - Entry point for running the server

**Frontend:**
- `/frontend/package.json` - Node dependencies
- `/frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `/frontend/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `/frontend/src/index.css` - Tailwind CSS imports

**Root:**
- `/.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore patterns
- `/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `/init.sh` - Development setup and startup script

### Next Steps:

Milestone 2 is ready to begin, which involves implementing the Kalshi WebSocket client with RSA authentication. This includes:
- Creating Pydantic models for trade messages
- Implementing RSA signature authentication
- Building the WebSocket client with reconnection logic
- Setting up subscription to public trades channel

The foundation is now solid with both backend and frontend properly configured and ready for feature development.

## CSS Fix - Post Milestone 4
**Date:** 2025-12-03, 10:16 PM PST
**Time Taken:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** COMPLETED

### Issue Resolved:
- Frontend was showing unstyled HTML with live WebSocket data flowing
- Tailwind CSS v4 was not properly compiling/applying styles
- Application appeared as raw HTML despite correct class names

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3.3.6** for stability
2. **Updated PostCSS configuration** to use traditional Tailwind v3 setup
3. **Created beautiful custom theme** with:
   - Dark mode with gray-950 background
   - Custom colors for YES (green) and NO (red) trades
   - Primary brand colors (purple/indigo inspired by Kalshi)
   - Custom animations and shadow effects
4. **Enhanced index.css** with custom utilities and component styles
5. **Reinstalled dependencies** and restarted dev server

### Current State:
✅ Frontend running on localhost:5173 with beautiful dark theme
✅ Live Kalshi trade data flowing via WebSocket
✅ Responsive two-column layout (trade tape + hot markets)
✅ Proper YES/NO color coding for trades
✅ Custom scrollbars and smooth animations
✅ Professional modern design matching specifications

### Verification:
- CSS compilation confirmed working (Tailwind v3.3.6)
- Visual inspection shows all styles properly applied
- Application now has professional, polished appearance
- All milestone 4 requirements met

### Commit:
- f7cdfee - "Fix Tailwind CSS build issues by downgrading to v3"

### Next Steps:
The frontend is now fully functional and beautiful. Phase 1 is complete.
Ready to proceed with Phase 2 features when requested.
