✅ TICKER DETAIL VIEW ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED

📊 Successfully Updated TickerDetailDrawer to Use VolumeWeightedSparkline

## What Was Done:

1. **Component Update**:
   - Replaced old basic Sparkline component with the new VolumeWeightedSparkline
   - Updated import statement in TickerDetailDrawer.jsx
   - Applied larger dimensions (420x100px) suitable for detail view context

2. **Enhanced Configuration**:
   - Set width to 420px and height to 100px for better visibility in detail view
   - Enabled volume indicators with showVolumeIndicators=true
   - Set animation duration to 400ms for smooth transitions
   - Added proper CSS classes for responsive layout

3. **Visual Consistency**:
   - Updated section title to "Live Price Momentum" to match market cards
   - Maintained the same color scheme and styling approach
   - Kept the same animation timing and visual effects as market cards

4. **Data Compatibility**:
   - Verified backend provides enhanced price_points data structure
   - Confirmed data format includes: price, volume, timestamp, side
   - VolumeWeightedSparkline component handles this data perfectly
   - Backward compatibility maintained for legacy data formats

## Technical Details:

**Backend Data Structure** (already compatible):
```javascript
{
  "price": trade.yes_price_dollars,    // Price in dollars
  "volume": trade.count,               // Trade volume
  "timestamp": trade.ts,               // Timestamp in milliseconds
  "side": trade.taker_side            // "yes" or "no" for momentum
}
```

**Component Configuration**:
```jsx
<VolumeWeightedSparkline 
  data={marketData.price_points || []} 
  width={420} 
  height={100}
  className="w-full"
  showVolumeIndicators={true}
  animationDuration={400}
/>
```

## Enhanced Features Now Available in Detail View:

1. **Volume-Weighted Line Thickness**: Line thickness varies based on trade volume
2. **Momentum-Based Colors**: Green for bullish momentum, red for bearish, gray for neutral
3. **Real-Time Pulse Effects**: Animated pulse on the most recent price point
4. **Volume Indicators**: Subtle volume bars underneath the price line
5. **Gradient Backgrounds**: Background gradients showing overall trend strength
6. **Smooth Animations**: Smooth entry animations when new data arrives
7. **High-Momentum Glow**: Extra glow effects for segments with high momentum

## Result:

The ticker detail view now displays the same sophisticated volume-weighted momentum visualization as the market cards, just scaled appropriately for the larger detail view context. Users get a consistent visual experience with enhanced price intelligence when they drill down into individual market details.

Both the market cards and detail view now show the same advanced price visualization, providing a cohesive and intelligent trading interface throughout the application.
