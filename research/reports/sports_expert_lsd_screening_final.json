    "sports_betting_translation": "Most sports betting concepts did NOT translate well to Kalshi. Steam moves, public fades, and category contagion all failed.",

    "methodology_bugs": "SPORTS-015 had look-ahead bias (using final_price to determine bet direction). Always verify signals don't use future information.",
    "lsd_mode_value": "Rapid screening correctly flagged SPORTS-015's 33% edge as suspicious, leading to bug discovery."
