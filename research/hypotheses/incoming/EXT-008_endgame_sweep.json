  "mechanism": "On Polymarket, the 'Endgame Sweep' strategy buys outcomes at 95-99c and holds to resolution for near-guaranteed profit. The edge comes from market friction and time value. In Kalshi, do trades at 95c+ still have edge after accounting for the rare upset?",
  "proposed_signal": {
    "condition": "YES price >= 95c AND market has <24 hours to resolution",
    "action": "Buy YES (capture the last few cents)",
    "expected_edge": "+1-3% if near-certainties are slightly underpriced"
  },
  "data_requirements": ["yes_price", "is_winner", "close_time (if available)"],
  "price_proxy_risk": "HIGH - pure price-based, but time-conditional",
  "novelty_vs_tested": "S003 (NO at 90-100c) was INVALIDATED. This tests the OPPOSITE - buying YES at extreme high prices",
  "priority": "LOW"
