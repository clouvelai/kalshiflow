  "mechanism": "Sharp syndicates sometimes place early bets to move the line, then 'buy back' with larger bets on the opposite side at better prices. In Kalshi, if early trades favor YES but late trades favor NO with larger size, the late reversal may be the 'real' bet.",

    "condition": "First half of trades favor side A, second half favors side B with larger average size",
    "action": "Follow the late-half direction",
    "expected_edge": "+5-10% if late reversals are intentional sharp plays"

  "data_requirements": ["timestamp", "taker_side", "count"],

  "novelty_vs_tested": "H115 tested 'commitment reversal' by same-size trades. This tests temporal half reversal with size increase",
