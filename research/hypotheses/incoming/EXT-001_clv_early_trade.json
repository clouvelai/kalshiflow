  "mechanism": "In sports betting, bets placed >24 hours before the event show +1.2% CLV while bets in the final hour show -0.5%. Early traders capture value before market efficiency kicks in. Can we detect 'early' trades in Kalshi markets that have similar edge?",

    "condition": "Trade occurs in first 25% of market lifespan (by trade count or time)",

  "novelty_vs_tested": "H047 tested 'time proximity edge' but focused on LATE trades. This tests EARLY trades specifically",
