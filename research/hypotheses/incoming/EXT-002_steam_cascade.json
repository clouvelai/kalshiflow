  "mechanism": "A 'steam move' occurs when many trades hit in rapid succession in the same direction, causing sudden price movement. This indicates coordinated sharp action. In Kalshi, can we detect 'bursts' of same-direction trades that predict outcomes?",
  "proposed_signal": {
    "condition": "5+ trades in same direction within 60 seconds, causing >5c price move",
    "action": "Follow the steam direction",
    "expected_edge": "+3-7% if steam moves are informed"
  },
  "data_requirements": ["timestamp", "taker_side", "yes_price", "count"],
  "price_proxy_risk": "MEDIUM - involves price change, but measures velocity/coordination",
  "novelty_vs_tested": "H088 tested millisecond bursts but focused on NO consensus. This tests directional steam with price impact",
  "priority": "HIGH"
