  "mechanism": "On Polymarket, traders profit from 'correlated asset lag' - e.g., betting on a cabinet pick after a presidential win is confirmed, before that market adjusts. In Kalshi, when related markets exist, does resolution of one predict movement in another?",

    "condition": "Market A resolves, related market B exists, bet on B in direction consistent with A outcome",
    "action": "Trade correlated markets before they adjust",
    "expected_edge": "+5-12% if cross-market lag exists"

  "data_requirements": ["market_ticker", "event_ticker", "is_winner", "timestamp"],
  "price_proxy_risk": "LOW - measures cross-market relationship",
  "novelty_vs_tested": "H111 (same-event multi-market) is still QUEUED. This is similar but focuses on POST-resolution lag",
  "priority": "MEDIUM"
