  "title": "VPIN-Style Order Flow Toxicity",
  "mechanism": "VPIN measures the probability of informed trading by tracking order flow imbalance velocity. High toxicity = high probability of informed traders present. In Kalshi, we can compute trade imbalance velocity - if YES trades are accelerating faster than NO trades, informed traders may be loading YES.",
  "proposed_signal": {
    "condition": "Rolling 10-trade imbalance changes by >50% in a short window",
    "action": "Follow the direction of accelerating imbalance",
    "expected_edge": "+3-6% if flow acceleration indicates informed trading"

  "data_requirements": ["timestamp", "taker_side", "count"],
  "price_proxy_risk": "LOW - measures trade flow velocity, not price levels",
  "novelty_vs_tested": "H052 tested order flow imbalance rate-of-change but was REJECTED as price proxy. This uses ACCELERATION (second derivative) not just velocity",
  "priority": "MEDIUM"
