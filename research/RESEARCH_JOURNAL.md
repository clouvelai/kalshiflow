# Quant Research Journal

This is the living journal of all research sessions. The quant agent MUST update this file at the start and end of every research session.

2. Review any incomplete work from previous sessions
3. Add a new session entry with date and objectives

### At Session End
1. Document what was tested and results
2. Update "Active Research Questions" with new questions discovered
3. Move completed questions to "Resolved Questions"
4. Update the "Hypothesis Tracker" table

## Active Research Questions

*Questions we're actively investigating. Pick one to continue or add new ones.*

1. **[OPEN]** Are there time-of-day patterns in Kalshi trading? (morning vs evening edge)
2. **[OPEN]** Do category-specific strategies exist? (sports vs politics vs crypto)
3. **[OPEN]** Can we detect informed traders before price moves?
4. **[OPEN]** Is there edge in fading whale consensus (contrarian)?
5. **[OPEN]** Do new markets show initial mispricing?

## Resolved Questions

*Questions we've answered with data. Include the answer and link to detailed analysis.*

| Question | Answer | Evidence | Date |
|----------|--------|----------|------|
| Is whale-following profitable at 30-70c? | NO - concentration risk | >30% profit from single markets | 2024-12-28 |
| Does YES at 80-90c have edge? | YES - +5.1% | 2,110 markets, validated | 2024-12-28 |
| Does following 100% whale consensus work? | NO - 27% win rate | Contrarian might work | 2024-12-28 |

## Session Log

### Session 002 - 2025-12-29
**Objective**: Deep pattern hunting - explore untested hypotheses and find new trading edges
**Continuing from**: Session 001 findings (whale consensus is anti-predictive)
**Analyst**: Quant Agent (Opus 4.5)

**Hypotheses to Test**:
1. H007: Fade whale consensus (contrarian) - if following loses, fading should win
2. H005: Time-of-day patterns - morning vs evening, hour-of-day effects
3. H006: Category-specific efficiency - some categories less efficient?
4. H008: New market mispricing - early trades have edge?
5. H009 (NEW): Price velocity/momentum - rapid price moves create reversals?
6. H010 (NEW): Trade sequencing patterns - order of trades predicts outcome?
7. H011 (NEW): Volume-weighted signals - high-volume periods have different edge?
8. H012 (NEW): Round number effects - prices cluster at 25/50/75c?

**Session Status**: IN PROGRESS

### Session 001 - 2024-12-28
**Objective**: Analyze whale-following strategies from public trade feed
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Analyst**: Quant Agent

**Hypotheses Tested**:
1. H003: Whale-following at moderate prices → REJECTED (concentration)
2. H004: 100% whale consensus → REJECTED (27% win rate, contrarian signal)

**Key Findings**:
- Whale-following fails validation due to profit concentration in single markets
- When 100% of whales agree, following them LOSES money
- This suggests contrarian whale-fading might work (H007 queued)

**New Questions Generated**:
- Should we FADE whale consensus instead of following?
- Are there specific whale SIZE thresholds that matter?
- Do whales behave differently in different categories?

**Next Steps**:
- Test H007 (fade whale consensus)
- Investigate time-of-day patterns (H005)
- Look at category-specific behaviors

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `research/strategies/MVP_STRATEGY_IDEAS.md` - Main analysis doc
- `research/strategies/rejected/whale-following-analysis.md`
- `research/analysis/public_trade_feed_analysis.py`

## Data Inventory

*What data do we have available for analysis?*

| Dataset | Records | Date Range | Location |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| Public trades | ~1.7M | All time | `research/data/trades/` |
| Settled markets | ~78k | All time | `research/data/markets/` |
| Market outcomes | ~78k | All time | `research/data/markets/market_outcomes_ALL.csv` |
| Enriched trades | ~1.7M | All time | `research/data/trades/enriched_trades_resolved_ALL.csv` |

## Promising Leads

*Patterns or anomalies noticed but not yet fully investigated*

1. **Whale consensus contrarian**: When 100% of whales agree, fading them might work (27% follow = 73% fade?)
2. **Category efficiency variance**: Some categories might be less efficient than others
3. **Time decay patterns**: Edge might change as market approaches expiry
4. **Round number effects**: Prices might cluster at 25c, 50c, 75c

---

## Dead Ends (Don't Revisit)

*Approaches we've thoroughly tested and confirmed don't work*

1. **Simple whale-following at any price**: Fails concentration test
2. **Following unanimous whale consensus**: Negative edge
